-Deployment issues: Server should be on the same domain as the database since connection is  clear text. Else snooping is possible
Impact Critical
Probability low
Mitigation: Implement SSL connection between Server and Database

-Scalability: Server has low scalability due to RPC and threaded design. Can't support a large database with millions of records
Impact: High 
Probability low
Mitigation: None

-Deadline: Process model doesn't allow for large last minute changes.
Impact: High
Probability medium
Mitigation: Ask for extenstion 

-Sudden cancellation
Impact: High
Probability medium
Mitigation: none. Achive the project and reuse if possible.

-DDOS: Especially a concern, since the design is centered around a server. Errecting more servers will result in a unsynchronized infrastructure. 
Impact: High
Prob: medium
Mitigation: Improve the infrastructure by adding UTMs, caching DNS, subscribe to 3rd party DDOS protection services.

-Sudden resignation of a large amount of employees
Impact: High
Prob: Low
Mitigation: renegotiate the terms of the contract: deliver less features.

-Sudden change or discovery of requirements near deadline
Impact: High
Prob: High
Mitigation: Accept (Try and negotiate the deadline or terms. Process model doesn't support this).
